I have always had a facination with the natural world. Growing up I was surrounded by nature, family holidays revolved around wildlife and we have always had a lot of pets. So, when my parents bought me my first camera in my early teens, I fell in love. 

### Gear

#### Camera
* Canon EOS 5D MkIV
* Canon EOS 7D

#### Lens
* Canon 100-400mm L
* Canon 17-40mm L

#### Other bits
* Manfrotto tripod legs + ball head
* Canon Speedlite 430EX II
* Off-camera flash cord
* HÃ¤hnel Giga T Pro II remote control
* Various filters
* Extension tubes

#### Bag
Finding a decent bag to carry all my equipment in while out and about was quite a challenge. I wanted something that was comfortable to wear for long periods of time while out walking, that I could fit a camera with the 100-400mm lens, my wide angle lens, and still have room for a laptop (when travelling), jacket, food, drink etc. All of the dedicated camera bags that fit this specification were quite expensive, so I decided to do a bit of DIY and build my own. 

In the end, I settled for an Osprey travel bag, as the zip into the main section went all the way down to the bottom of the bag - great for accessing my gear - and it had another pocket that would fit my laptop easily. I then bought two removable camera cases to place inside the bag, one that would fit the 100-400mm lens with camera attached, and another that has dividers to hold my wide angle lens plus a few other bits. This turned out perfectly, it holds everything I need for a trip away, and is comfortable to wear even when stuffed full of gear!
