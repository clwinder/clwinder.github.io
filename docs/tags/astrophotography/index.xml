      <description>It’s been far too long since I’ve last written a blog post about my photography, life has a habit of getting in the way sometimes! But I managed to get a clear night, so decided to head out into the darkness to try and photograph NEOWISE. In this post I’ll discuss my set up, how I shot the images, and processed them afterwards.
I’ve dabbled in a bit of astrophotography, mainly just landscapes with the Milky Way if I’ve been away in dark sky areas.</description>
