      <description>It’s been far too long since I’ve last written a blog post about my photography, life has a habit of getting in the way sometimes! But I managed to get a clear night, so decided to head out into the darkness to try and photograph NEOWISE. In this post I’ll discuss my set up, how I shot the images, and processed them afterwards.
I’ve dabbled in a bit of astrophotography, mainly just landscapes with the Milky Way if I’ve been away in dark sky areas.</description>

      <description>I’ve finally managed to get round to writing this blog post about my recent trip to Shetland! I have long wanted to go, but until now have never got round to it, there are just so many amazing places around the world to visit. We chose the end of May for the trip, as the breading season for the millions of sea birds that call Shetland home will be well under way.</description>
